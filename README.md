UBUNTU WORKSTATION

This is a single script setup of basic developer tools for running post OS install.

the configurations folder in the user.configuration file. The comments in that file 
should be clear enough. THERE ARE REQUIRED FIELDS. I've maintained a list at the top
of the file of all required fields.
